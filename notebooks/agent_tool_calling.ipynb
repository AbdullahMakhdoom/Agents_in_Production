    "### Secure tool calling with Arcade.dev\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is going to close one of the biggest gaps between demo and production agents: Secure tool-calling\n",
    "\n",
    "When your agents work well in your computer, they are excellent personal assistants, but scaling that up to many users is not easy, as the security assumptions from a local deployment do not apply to agents at scale. Personal Access Tokens simply won't cut it for multiple users. Even if you encapsulate all of the functionality in a remote MCP server, tool-level auth will require you to implement the auth flow for all the providers that your agent relies on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arcade solves this by providing a unified platform for agentic tool calling and execution. It will handle the auth flow for you offering a secure multi-user solution for your agents.\n",

      "\n",
      "Typical recommended stacks (examples)\n",
      "- Web app agent that calls user’s Google/Calendar:\n",
      "  - Node: openid-client + Passport or Pizzly for connector; store tokens in Vault; LangChain agent calls your backend tool endpoint.\n",
      "- Batch ingestion to feed LLMs (data sync):\n",
      "  - Airbyte connectors or custom scripts using authlib / requests-oauthlib; secrets stored in Vault.\n",
