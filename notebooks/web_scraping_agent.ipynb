    "# Building an Intelligent Web Scraping Agent with LangGraph and Bright Data + MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive notebook demonstrates how to build a production-ready web scraping agent that combines LangGraph's ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework with Bright Data's advanced scraping infrastructure. The resulting system can intelligently navigate websites, extract structured data, and conduct complex research workflows with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent you'll build represents a significant advancement over traditional web scraping approaches. Instead of writing custom scrapers for each website, you'll create an intelligent system that can reason about different scraping strategies, select appropriate tools, and adapt to various web structures automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this notebook, you will understand how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement LangGraph ReAct agents with external tool integration for autonomous decision-making\n",
    "- Configure Bright Data's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for enterprise-grade web scraping\n",
    "- Design intelligent agents that dynamically select optimal scraping strategies based on target websites\n",
    "- Extract structured data from major platforms including e-commerce sites, social media, and news sources\n",
    "- Implement browser automation workflows for complex user interactions\n",
    "- Build comprehensive research pipelines that synthesize information from multiple sources\n",

    "## Understanding the ReAct Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework represents a significant advancement in autonomous agent design. Unlike traditional rule-based systems or simple chain-of-thought approaches, ReAct agents integrate reasoning capabilities with action execution in a unified framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Principles of ReAct Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct agents operate on a fundamental principle that combines deliberative reasoning with interactive tool usage. This approach enables agents to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Reasoning**: The agent analyzes each situation and develops a reasoning strategy tailored to the specific task requirements. Rather than following predetermined scripts, it evaluates available information and determines the most effective approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool Selection**: Based on its reasoning, the agent selects appropriate tools from its available repertoire. This selection process considers factors such as data requirements, website characteristics, and desired output formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative Refinement**: The agent can execute multiple actions in sequence, using the results of previous actions to inform subsequent decisions. This capability is particularly valuable for complex web scraping scenarios that require multi-step workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application to Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of web scraping, ReAct agents excel because they can adapt their approach based on the target website's characteristics. For instance, when encountering an e-commerce site, the agent might recognize the need for structured product data extraction. Conversely, when analyzing news articles, it might prioritize content extraction and summarization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This adaptability eliminates the need for maintaining separate scraping scripts for different websites, significantly reducing development overhead while improving reliability and maintainability."

    "### MCP Architecture Benefits\n",
    "\n",

      "============================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "📊 Research Complete!\n",
      "Here’s a comprehensive research summary on “Impact of artificial intelligence on job markets in 2025,” based on five recent, high-quality sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Executive Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "AI is having a nuanced and sector-specific impact on job markets in 2025. Contrary to early fears of large-scale job losses, most research and expert opinion finds that aggregate employment disruption remains limited, but significant “friction” exists for certain groups, especially recent graduates and workers in highly automatable roles. There is a growing wage and productivity premium for workers and industries able to leverage AI, with adaptation and upskilling becoming urgent. While some industries face job losses or restructuring, overall, AI-exposed industries are seeing higher revenue and wage growth, and there’s evidence of job creation in new and hybrid roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Current News and Developments**\n",
      "- **Forbes (Nov 2025):** Recent comprehensive studies assert that AI’s net effect on employment is currently negligible—even as AI-related investment and adoption surge. No widespread layoffs can be attributed to AI alone ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2025/11/13/ais-impact-on-employment-is-negligible-study-asserts/)).\n",
      "- **CNBC (Nov 2025):** Entry-level job seekers, especially new college graduates, face a tough market. Only 30% of 2025 grads secured full-time work in their fields, down from 41% the previous year. AI is a substantial factor, reducing demand for certain entry-level and “white-collar” jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Expert Opinions and Analysis**\n",
      "- **Stanford Digital Economy Lab (Oct 2025, Bharat Chandar et al.):** While overall job numbers are steady, AI may be substantially reducing hiring for entry-level roles, particularly those with high exposure to automation. Experts emphasize the urgent need for better data and modeling as the landscape evolves. There is consensus that adaptation—not mass unemployment—is the dominant trend, but risks for young workers are real.\n",
      "- **Stanford & Related Research:** There is strong evidence of uneven effects: industries and roles “augmented” with AI can see rising productivity, while “automatable” jobs face contraction. The impact is not uniform across countries or demographics, with the US labor market seeing the sharpest effects on new entrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Statistical Data and Trends**\n",
      "- **PwC Global AI Jobs Barometer (2025):**\n",
      "    - Industries more exposed to AI see 3x faster revenue growth per worker.\n",
      "    - Wage growth is 2x higher in these industries.\n",
      "    - Workers with AI skills earn a 56% wage premium over similar non-AI-skilled workers.\n",
      "    - The speed of skill change in AI-exposed roles increased by 66% (over 2024 levels).\n",
      "    - 1.1 million layoffs were announced in 2025, a 65% year-over-year jump, highly concentrated in technology sectors.\n",
      "- **Labor Research (Revelio Labs):** Entry-level job post openings have dropped 35% since January 2023 in the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Social Media & Popular Sentiment**\n",
      "- While not a major focus in the academic literature, media coverage and polling (referenced by CNBC and Stanford) indicate rising anxiety among young workers and students about job security and value of traditional education. Companies express the need for more skilled, adaptive employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Key Players and Companies**\n",
      "- **Industries Leading Adoption:** Technology, Finance, Energy, Professional Services, Government/Public Sector.\n",
      "- **Top Companies Integrating AI:** PwC, Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic, Salesforce.\n",
      "- **AI service providers and consultancies:** PwC, J.P. Morgan, and others are facilitating widespread AI adoption for their clients, driving demand for AI-literate workers.\n",

      "\n",
      "In summary: While AI is dramatically accelerating change across the job market, there is—so far—no evidence of catastrophic job loss for the workforce at large. The greatest disruption is concentrating on young, entry-level, and white-collar roles exposed to automation. Adaptation, reskilling, and hybrid human-AI collaboration are crucial themes. Workers and industries able to master AI are being rewarded with higher wages and growth, while laggards risk marginalization. Policymakers, educators, and employers are being pressed to create new pathways for training and skills adaptation to ensure inclusive, sustainable employment amid fast technological change.\n",
