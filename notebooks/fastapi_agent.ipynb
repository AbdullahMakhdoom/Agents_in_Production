        "## What is FastAPI and Why Use It for Agents?\n",
        "\n",
        "FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. Released in 2018, it has quickly gained popularity due to its combination of speed, ease of use, and developer-friendly features.\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, FastAPI is designed to create REST APIs that can serve requests efficiently while providing robust validation and documentation. For AI agent deployment, FastAPI offers several critical advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Asynchronous Support**: AI agents often need to handle concurrent requests efficiently. FastAPI's native async/await support enables handling thousands of simultaneous connections, perfect for serving multiple agent requests in parallel without blocking.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Streaming Responses**: Agents frequently generate content incrementally (token by token). FastAPI's streaming response capabilities allow for real-time transmission of agent outputs as they're generated, creating a more responsive user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Type Validation**: When working with agents, ensuring proper input formats is crucial. FastAPI uses Pydantic for automatic request validation, catching malformed inputs before they reach your agent and providing clear error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Performance**: Built on Starlette and Uvicorn, FastAPI offers near-native performance. For compute-intensive agent applications, this means your infrastructure handles API overhead efficiently, allowing more resources for the actual agent processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Automatic Documentation**: When exposing an agent API to multiple users or teams, documentation becomes essential. FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc, making it easy for others to understand and use your agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Schema Enforcement**: Pydantic models ensure that both requests to your agent and responses from it conform to predefined schemas, making agent behavior more predictable and easier to integrate with other systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll build a complete API that serves an AI agent with both synchronous and streaming endpoints, demonstrating how FastAPI's features address the specific challenges of deploying agents in production."
